\chapter{System Overview} \label{ch:system-overview}

The board has an MSP430 low-power microcontroller that runs the firmware application and several other peripherals for extended operation and physical interfaces (i.e., non-volatile memory, watchdog timer, service modules, payloads interfaces, daughterboard interface, and current monitor). The microcontroller manages the other sub-modules within the board using serial communication buses, synchronizes actions, handles communication with the ground segment, and manages the data flow. The programming language used is C, and the firmware was developed using the Code Composer Studio IDE\nomenclature{\textbf{IDE}}{\textit{Integrated Development Environment.}} (a.k.a. CCS) for compiling, programming and testing. The module has many tasks over distinct protocols and time requirements, such as interfacing peripherals and other MCUs. To improve predictability, a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS\nomenclature{\textbf{RTOS}}{\textit{Real-Time Operating System.}}) is used to ensure that the deadlines are observed, even under a faulty situation in a routine. The RTOS chosen is the FreeRTOS (v10.0.0), since it is designed for embedded systems applications and was already validated in space applications. The firmware architecture follows an abstraction layer scheme to facilitate higher-level implementations and allow more portability across different hardware platforms.

\section{Product tree}

The product tree of the OBDH 2.0 module is available in \autoref{fig:product-tree}.

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Block Diagram}

\autoref{fig:block-diagram} presents a simplified view of the module subsystems and interfaces. The microcontroller has a programming JTAG\nomenclature{\textbf{JTAG}}{\textit{Joint Test Action Group.}}
 and 6 communication buses, divided into 3 different protocols (I2C\nomenclature{\textbf{I2C}}{\textit{Inter-Integrated Circuit.}}, SPI\nomenclature{\textbf{SPI}}{\textit{Serial Peripheral Interface.}}, and UART\nomenclature{\textbf{UART}}{\textit{Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter.}}), that is shared between all the peripherals and external interfaces. Besides these channels, there are GPIO\nomenclature{\textbf{GPIO}}{\textit{General Purpose Input/Output.}} connections for various functions, from control ports to status pins. There is a non-volatile memory device to store the satellite data frames and critical status indicators. Some buffers and transceivers allow secure and proper communication with external modules. A watchdog timer with a voltage monitor and a current sensor is attached to the system to improve the overall reliability and generate essential housekeeping data. There is a generic daughterboard interface for extending the module capabilities with an auxiliary application board. Also, a UART debug interface is directly connected to the microcontroller. More details and descriptions about these components and interfaces are provided in \autoref{ch:hardware}.

        \label{fig:block-diagram}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{System Layers}

As mentioned, the system is divided into abstraction layers to favor high-level firmware implementations. The \autoref{fig:system-layers} shows this scheme, composed of third-party drivers at the lowest layer above the hardware, the operating system as the base building block of the module, the devices handling implementation, and the application tasks in the highest layer. More details are provided in  \autoref{ch:firmware}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/system_layers.pdf}
        \caption{System layers.}
        \label{fig:system-layers}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Operation}

The system operates through the sequential execution of routines (tasks in the context of the operating system) that are scheduled and multiplexed over time. Each routine has a priority and a periodicity, determining the subsequent execution, the set of functionalities currently running, and the memory usage management. Besides this deterministic scheduling system, the routines have communication channels with each other through the usage of queues, which provides a robust synchronization scheme. In \autoref{ch:firmware} the system operation and the internal nuances are described in detail. Then, this section uses a top-view user perspective to describe the module operation.

\subsection{Execution Flow}
