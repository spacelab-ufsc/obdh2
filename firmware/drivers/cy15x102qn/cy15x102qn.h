 * the first byte of the read operation and then a dummy byte. The dummy byte inserts a read latency of 8-clock
 * cycle. The fast read operation is otherwise the same as an ordinary read operation except that it requires
 * an additional dummy byte. After receiving the opcode, address, and a dummy byte, the CY15X102QN starts
 * driving its SO line with data bytes, with MSB first, and continues transmitting as long as the device is
 * selected and the clock is available. In case of bulk read, the internal address counter is incremented
 * automatically, and after the last address 3FFFFh is reached, the counter rolls over to 00000h. When the
 * device is driving data on its SO line, any transition on its SI line is ignored. The rising edge of CS
 * terminates a fast read operation and tristates the SO pin. 
 *
 * \note The dummy byte can be any 8-bit value but Axh (8'b1010xxxx). The lower 4 bits of Axh are don't care
