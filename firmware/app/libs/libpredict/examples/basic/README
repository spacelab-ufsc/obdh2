This example application shows how to calculate and print the position
of the International Space Station (latitude, longitude and altitude)
from a hard coded two-line element. The application will continue
printing the updated position until it's aborted.

The provided CMakeLists.txt assumes libpredict and its development files are
installed on the system.
