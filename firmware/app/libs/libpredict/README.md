libpredict
==========

A satellite orbit prediction library.


Building
--------

We recommend using out-of-source builds.

```
cd $SOURCEDIR
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


Installation
------------

```
make install
```

The install location is defined by `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, which
defaults to `/usr/local`. To relocate the whole installation (to make
usr/local etc. inside another directory, e.g., if you want to make a
tarball or package it afterwards), use `make DESTDIR=/foo/bar install`.

Linking
-------

The library comes with pkg-config information, so the include and
library paths and flags can be found using the `pkg-config` command or
by using the `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` autotools macro or CMake command.

Quickstart
----------

We recommend to investigate the examples under `examples/` and the API documentation in `include/predict/predict.h`.

A condensed version is that
```
predict_orbital_elements_t *orbital_elements = orbital_elements = predict_parse_tle(tle_line_1, tle_line_2);
```
parses a TLE in the form of two char arrays to orbital elements representing a satellite, and that
```
predict_observer_t *observer = predict_create_observer(name, latitude_radians, longitude_radians, altitude_meters);
```
defines a QTH for observation. For prediction,
```
struct predict_position orbit;
predict_orbit(orbital_elements, &orbit, prediction_time);
```
can be used to calculate properties that are independent of an observer (longitude, latitude, ...), while
```
struct predict_observation observation;
predict_observe_orbit(observer, &orbit, &observation);
```
will convert to properties that will be relative to our observer (azimuth, elevation, ...).
